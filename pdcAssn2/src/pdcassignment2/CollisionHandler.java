/**
 * This class is needed to change the behaviour of how game figures handle
 * collision, at run time. For example, although the coin class is a
 * MoveableFigure, the way it handles collisions with the Dinosaur is a little
 * bit different. So the Coin class can be composed of a CoinCollisionHandler
 * which inherits from CollideableCollisionHandler, which inherits from
 * CollisionHandler.
 *
 * You might be thinking, why can't the Coin class simply override the
 * handleCollision class instead of going through all this fuss? Well it's
 * because Coin is (Just like any other MoveableFigures) COMPOSED OF a
 * MoveableObject, but does not INHERIT FROM MoveableObject, only MoveableObject
 * can directly use the CollisionHandler's methods such as handleCollision (in
 * other words, these methods are not visible from the concrete decorator Coin,
 * so it is pointless to override them). Why not make those methods visible is
 * due to a decision made to delegate the responsibilities of moving the figure
 * as well as checking for collisions to the wrappee MoveableObject.
